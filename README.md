# Foodies
The web application "Foodies" is a modern and user-friendly social media platform designed for people who are passionate about food and beverages. It allows users to post pictures and captions of their food experiences, whether it's something they have tasted, prepared, or are craving. Instead of a traditional "Like" button, the platform uses a "Yummy" option to match the food theme.

Users can also engage with each other by liking and commenting on posts. Additionally, the platform includes a "Find a Friend" section where users can follow other users and discover new food enthusiasts.

One of the key objectives of Foodies is to provide a secure and enjoyable user experience. To achieve this, modern technologies such as REST APIs and Spring Boot are utilized in the development process.

The application emphasizes easy registration and aims to create a safe and welcoming community for food lovers. It strives to showcase talent and promote meaningful interactions among users.
